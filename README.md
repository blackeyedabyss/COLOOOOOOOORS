# COLOOOOOOOORS
COLOOOOOOOORS! is a project based on HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript, which enables users to create their own custom color palettes with each color's HEX values. The user can copy the hexes, save the palettes in the local storage of the browser, and can save multiple color palettes!
